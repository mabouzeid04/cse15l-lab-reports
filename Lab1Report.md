# Section 1: Downloading VS Code
 
In order to install VS Code I first navigated to the VS code website link [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

I then pressed download for your operating system which is mac. 
Once my download was complete I was presented with the following when I opened the app:

# Section 2: Connecting remotely

To connect remotely I opened the terminal through the menu at the top of the window. 
Then I typed in `` ssh `` + my username into the terminal at the bottom. 
If you don't already know your username you can find it [here]([here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
I had to respond yes to connect becasue it was a new system.
The system asked for my password and I typed it in.
While connecting remotely, I had some issues because I typed in the wrong username. I forgot to include the @ieng6.ucsd.edu. Then I had another issue because I repeatedly typed in the wrong password.

# Section 3: Trying some commands
Once I typed my password in correctly, I had successfully connected remotely to the school computers. 
I tried out a bunch of commands such as `` cd ~ ``, ``cd ``, `ls` and ``ls-lat `` to explore what they did.
It seems that ``ls-lat`` is used to display a list of files and sub-directories in the current directory. ``cd `` and `` cd ~ `` did nothing because I gave them no arguments, usually they are used to change direction. `ls` is used to list all files in the current directory. `ls` returned `perl5` and I'm not completely sure what that means. I will ask a TA next lecture.
