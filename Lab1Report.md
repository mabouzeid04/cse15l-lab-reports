# Section 2: Connecting remotely

To connect remotely I opened the terminal through the menu at the top of the window. 
Then I typed in ssh + my username into the terminal at the bottom. 
I had to respond yes to connect becasue it was a new system.
The system asked for my password and I typed it in.

# Section 3: Trying some commands
Once I typed my password in correctly, I had successfully connected remotely to the school computers. 
I tried out a bunch of commands such as cd ~, cd and ls-lat to explore what they did.
It seems that ls-lat is used to display a list of files and sub-directories in the current directory..
